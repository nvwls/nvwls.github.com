So what's the story behind NVWLS?  My last name is Nuspl and people
always want to add a vowel to the end.  Whether is be Nusple, Nuspli,
Nuspi.  Believe me I've seen it all.  I've been handed back
applications telling me that I "misspelled my last name".

When I was applying for graduate school and student loans, I would get
a lot of information verification phone calls.  I would keep on saying
"There are no vowels at the end of my last name."  And then, "No
vowels".  After one such episode, one of my office mates starting
refering to me as "No Vowels".  And "No Vowels" with no vowels is
"NVWLS".
