People often argue on what they think code does (usually from memory).
Someone else may have a different memory of the code, perhaps they remember
version 1.0 while the other is remembering version 2.0. The discussion is not
progressing...

Just stop. As [Neil deGrasse Tyson](https://twitter.com/neiltyson/status/868498159676395521?lang=en)
said "If an argument lasts more than five minutes then both sides are wrong."

Code is a tangible thing. Share the screen and actually look at the code. If
it still open for interpretation, collaborate and improve it. Execute
snippets of the code to see how it actually works. Add comments. Refactor to
clarify. Add tests. Add examples. Don't miss this opportunity for
improvement while you and others have context. Your future selves will thank
you.
