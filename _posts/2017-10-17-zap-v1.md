I'm happy to announce v1.0.0 of the [zap cookbook](https://github.com/nvwls/zap).

In keeping with [semver](http://semver.org/), v1.0.0 contains breaking changes. These were necessary to support custom resources.
* Instead of classes, `register` now takes resource name(s) and an optional block to translate the resource into an identifier.
* `zap_firewall` has been removed as the firewall cookbook manages the rules as a whole.
* `zap_apt_repos` has been removed as resource. Use the `zap::apt_repos` recipe instead.
* `zap_yum_repos` has been removed as resource. Use the `zap::yum_repos` recipe instead.

The best way to describe the changes to walk through a couple of the included recipes.

The recipe `zap::iptables_d` is used in conjunction with  [iptables cookbook](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/iptables). Given `iptables_rule 'foo'`, the file `/etc/iptables.d/foo` will be generated.

So let's dig into the recipe:

~~~ ruby
zap 'iptables_d' do
  action :disable

  register :iptables_rule

  collect do
    Dir
      .glob("/etc/iptables.d/#{node['zap']['iptables_d']['pattern']}")
      .map { |path| File.basename(path) }
  end
end
~~~

`collect` takes a block that will be executed to "collect" all of the existing resources.

Given the following tree:
~~~
/
└── etc
    └── iptables.d
        ├── https
        ├── obsolete
        └── ssh
~~~

`['https', 'obsolete', 'ssh']` will be returned.

`register` is passed an array of resource names that zap will look for in the resource collection. When zap prunes resources on disk, it will create an instance of the first resource name registered to `:delete` that on-disk resource.

To "delete" an `iptables_rule`, one need specifies a `:disable` action.

Back to the above example, calling `collect` we determined
~~~ ruby
existing = ['https', 'obsolete', 'ssh']
~~~
and walking through the resource collection, we determined
~~~ ruby
desired = ['https', 'ssh']
~~~
so 'obsolete' was determined to be extraneous. zap will add a resource as if
~~~ ruby
iptables_rule 'obsolete' do
  action :disable
end
~~~
was specified in a recipe.

Many resources do more than just delete the file. In this case, flush the rule set from the kernel so we cannot simply just `rm` the file.

Next let's look at the `zap::cron_d` recipe used inconjunction with the [cron cookbook](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/cron).

~~~ ruby
zap 'cron_d' do
  register :cron_d do |r|
    # sanitized_name
    r.name.tr('.', '-')
  end

  collect do
    Dir
      .glob("/etc/cron.d/#{node['zap']['cron_d']['pattern']}")
      .map { |path| File.basename(path) }
  end
end
~~~

When `cron_d` creates the on-disk file, dots are translated into dashes. So when `collect` discovers 'foo-bar', it has no idea if
~~~ ruby
cron_d 'foo-bar' do
  ...
end
~~~
or
~~~ ruby
cron_d 'foo.bar' do
  ...
end
~~~
was specified.

We solve this dilemma by passing an optional block to `register`.  When zap encounters `cron_d 'foo.bar'` in the resource collection it will return `'foo-bar'` to match what `collect` discovers on disk.

Finally, let's look at `zap::yum_repos`:
~~~ ruby
zap '/etc/yum.repos.d' do
  register :yum_repository

  collect do
    Dir
      .glob("/etc/yum.repos.d/#{node['zap']['yum_repos']['pattern']}.repo")
      .map { |path| File.basename(path, '.repo') }
  end
end
~~~

Since `yum_repository 'chef-stable'` will create `/etc/yum.repos.d/chef-stable.repo` we do the additional
`.map` to extract the corresponding name of the resource.

In all of the above example, we did a `glob` One set the appropriate node attribute if you wanted to restrict zap to a particular namespace, i.e. zap only the `acme-*` yum repos.

There are a couple other advanced features that one can leverage when building a zap.

For the `zap_crontab` you specify which user's crontab you want to zap.
~~~ ruby
register :cron do |r|
  r.name if r.user == @name
end
~~~
When zap walks the resource collection and finds a `cron`, it will return `r.name` is user matches.  If not, `nil` is returned and zap will skip that resource.

Finally there is a `purge` callout if you need to do anything special to remove the resource.
~~~ ruby
purge do |id|
  r = Chef::Resource::Cron.new(id, @run_context)
  r.action(:delete)
  r.user(@name)
  r
end
~~~

Whew, I know this is a lot to digest. While it may seem complicated, `zap` can be hugely powerful tool in your toolbox.
